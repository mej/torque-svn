The autogen.sh script was introduced in version 3.0 because we decided 
that svn should no longer store the files generated by autotools. As a
result, it makes sense for us to document the requirements for 
building TORQUE from source, as many in the community will desire to
checkout the code and build it.

Required packages:
For running autogen.sh:
autoconf
automake
libtool
pkg-config

Non-standard packages for building the source:
libssl-dev (name may vary among OSes)
